Plagiarism Detector – Java Desktop Application

Plagiarism Detector is a Java Swing–based desktop application developed to compare two code or text files and calculate the percentage of similarity between them. The system implements a token-frequency hashing algorithm for efficient string comparison and helps identify matching or potentially copied content. It provides an intuitive graphical user interface for file uploads, real-time similarity analysis, and automated PDF report generation for documentation purposes.

The application integrates JDBC with a MySQL database to store analysis records such as file names, similarity percentage, and timestamps, enabling persistent data tracking. The project follows a modular architecture by separating the user interface, business logic, database connectivity, and report generation components, ensuring better maintainability, scalability, and code organization.
